# What is needed to refactor the RvB Battlebot.
The battlebot code is horrific. Why? Just look at commands.js which does a billion seperate things as well as npc/player attacks which are basically copies of each other

Improvements:
 - Make a parent to the NPC/Player classes
 - Refactor the attack method into multiple methods
 - Seperate the commands into different files
